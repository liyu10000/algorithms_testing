## Statistical Testing for Comparing Supervised Classification Algorithms


### Presentation
This project is for a Statistics course (STAT500) and we have made a few slides for [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-5qK3rj4k-IbM43kP-IsINWNaBxVgk5toc9lDned4HY/edit?ts=5ddd8d09#slide=id.g6bb87d336b_0_26).

### Install
` pip3 install statsmodels`

### Problem Definition
Use statistical testing to determine if two binary classifiers have the same performance
 - Null Hypothesis H0: Two classifiers make errors in the same way
 - Alternative Hypothesis Ha: Two classifiers make errors differently

### Usage
Sample code is in `demo.py`.
